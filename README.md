# Java DSA Practice

This repository contains my Java-based solutions to common Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems.  
It is part of my preparation for coding interviews and placements at top tech companies like Adobe, Google, Amazon, and others.

## 🚀 Goals

- Strengthen core logic building in Java
- Master common DSA patterns (Two-pointer, Kadane's, Rotations, etc.)
- Build efficient and clean code for interviews

## ✅ Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings
- Searching & Sorting
- Two-Pointer Technique
- Kadane’s Algorithm
- Rotation-based Problems
- Subset Checks
- Missing and Duplicate Elements
- In-place Array Operations

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Language: Java
- IDE: Eclipse / IntelliJ / VS Code
- Compiler: JDK 17+

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each file is organized by topic or question, with clear class and method names.
