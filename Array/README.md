# Array

This folder contains Java programs to solve Data Structures and Algorithms problems related to Arrays. 

Topics covered:
- `ArrayDeclaration.java`: Basic array declaration, initialization, and printing in Java.
- Finding minimum and maximum
- Reverse an array
- Move zeros to the end
- Union and Intersection of arrays
- Missing number in array
- Cyclic rotation

Each file is named by the problem it solves. These are part of my DSA preparation for top product-based companies.
